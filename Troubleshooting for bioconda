###Q1ï¼šResolving Installation Errors: Conda Channel Configuration Method

##Error Encountered:  Without the appropriate version available during the Conda software installation, you can try resolving it this way

##Solution: 
For anyone struggling with installations, I recommend running 
        conda config --set channel_priority flexible 
and then back to 
        conda config --set channel_priority strict 
upon installation.
